HOW IT WORKS:

Open the text effect you wish to use. In the layers pannel there is 1 layer called "Text effect - double click thumbnail to edit", Double click the 
layer thumbnail or right click on the layer and select "Edit Contents". A message will appear, click "OK". A new window will open, replace the text 
with your own or use a different font and then close the window, a message will appear asking if you want to save, click "Yes" and you are done!

It also works with vector shapes, logos etc.

The folders have vector masks on. If you don't want texture on your text effect then just right click on the mask and select "Disable mask" or even delete.

Use the Hue/Saturation Adjustment to change the background color. Double click the thumbnail of the adjustment layer called "Change Background Color" to edit.
